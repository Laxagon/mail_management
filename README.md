# mail_management

My father gets an e-mail from the director of an activity school each week with the weekly schedules for each class.

He has to manually send the weekly schedules to the corresponding teacher in charge of the class, the parents of the children etc.

I therefore created this program to automatically send the weekly schedules from the e-mail of the school, and send them automatically to their corresponding teachers and students.
